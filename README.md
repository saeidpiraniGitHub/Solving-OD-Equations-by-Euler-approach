This software is for solving Lorentz attractor Ordinary Differential Equations by Euler approach. Numerical results are plotted and saved in PDF files for the 5 test cases. 
There is testing section for the code. 
If implemented step wise for numerically solving the equation result in less than 100 solution for any of test cases then an error will show up in testing section. Otherwise everything goes well. Please check output folder saved output results.
