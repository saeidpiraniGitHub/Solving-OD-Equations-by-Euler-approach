In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simple mathematical model of the way air moves around in the atmosphere. His model was a system of three ordinary differential equations (ODE) that demonstrate deterministic chaos at certain parameter values and initial conditions. The Lorentz attractor is the system's strange attractor that resembles a butterfly when visualized. The Lorenz system is nonlinear, three-dimensional, and deterministic. The Lorentz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorentz system and is possibly the most famous depiction of a system that exibits chaotic behavior. Very slight changes to the initial conditions of the system lead to wildly different solutions. The system itself describes the movement of a point in a three-dimensional space over time. The system is formally described by three ordinary differential equations that represent the movement of this point (x, y, z).
